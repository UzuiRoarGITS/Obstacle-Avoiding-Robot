# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
Description:
This repository hosts the source code, design files, and documentation for an autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot. Whether you're a robotics enthusiast, a student, or a hobbyist, this project offers a fantastic opportunity to explore the world of robotics and autonomous navigation.

Features:

Autonomous Navigation: The robot is equipped with sensors that allow it to autonomously detect and avoid obstacles in its path.
User-Friendly Interface: We've developed a user-friendly interface for remote control and monitoring of the robot's status.
Open Source: All code and design files are open source, making it easy for you to modify and customize the robot to suit your needs.
Extensive Documentation: Detailed documentation guides you through the assembly, programming, and customization of the robot.
Hardware and Software: This project encompasses both the hardware (robot chassis, sensors, and actuators) and software (Arduino-based code) aspects of building an obstacle-avoiding robot.
Getting Started:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the documentation to build the robot.
Upload the provided code to your Arduino board.
Start experimenting and customizing the robot's behavior!
